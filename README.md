Ideas for projects related to Kepler/K2

### Vision
The Kepler/K2 Guest Observer Office has tons of ideas.  We talk about them over lunch and on whiteboards, on conference calls and in traffic.  This repository aims to collect those ideas, partially for our own internal bookkeeping, partially as a transparent forum for feedback, and partially to guide projects for future students/interns.  The ideas may include aspects of data quality improvements, software development, and scientific applications.  The ideas make no claim to be original, technically feasible, or innovative; they are merely possible directions.


### Instructions for adding a new idea
Each idea should be registered as a unique GitHub Issue.  An automatic template will populate the GitHub Issue.  Simply fill out the description.  You may add optional information about the benefits and costs of the idea.

If you want **even more flexibility** than what a GitHub Issue can provide (*e.g.* LaTeX formatting), you can use a Jupyter notebook!  You can either add a supporting Jupyter notebook to an existing Issue, or make a fresh Pull Request for a new idea.  The Jupyter Notebooks can take any form, but the filename must begin with the prefix `ideaXXX`, where XXX is the zero-padded GitHub Issue or PR number associated with your idea.  This filename convention will help keep the ideas in chronological order and easily associated with their source.  Markdown formats are OK too.

### Upvoting
If you like an idea, you are encouraged to add a "plus-one" (:+1:) in the emoji response to the first description of the GitHub Issue or PR.
