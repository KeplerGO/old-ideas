Ideas for projects related to Kepler/K2

The Kepler/K2 Guest Observer Office has tons of ideas, we talk about them over lunch and on whiteboards, on conference calls and in traffic.  This repository aims to collect those ideas, partially for our own internal bookkeeping, partially as a transparent forum for feedback, and partially to guide projects for future students/interns.  The ideas may include aspects of data quality improvements, software development, and scientific applications.  The ideas make no claim to be original, technically feasible, or innovative; they are merely possible directions.

Each idea has its own file in the `ideas/` directory.  The file can be either markdown or ipython notebook.
